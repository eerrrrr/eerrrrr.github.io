                    <h3>Design Idea</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The project starts from the question of how existing residential buildings can be densified without losing social quality. Rather than treating the extension as a separate object, the new volume is designed as a continuation of the existing building, both structurally and spatially.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The upper level of the extension is conceived as a shared “communal living room.” Placing collective space above the housing allows daylight, views, and openness to support informal use, while keeping private apartments clearly defined below. The programme is intentionally flexible, allowing the space to adapt to different users and seasonal needs over time.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The extension is organised vertically by use. The lower level of the added volume contains new apartments, increasing the building’s residential capacity. The upper level is reserved for community use and remains largely open. This space can function as a library, lounge, indoor play area during harsh weather, or an event space for residents and the surrounding neighbourhood.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Balconies run along the façade and act as a transitional zone between interior spaces and the landscape. Visual connections toward the sea and adjacent green areas strengthen the relationship between the building and its context.

                    <h3>Structure & Timber System</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The extension is based on a 5.4 m × 6 m structural grid, allowing an open plan while maintaining structural clarity. The main load-bearing system consists of LVL post-and-beam columns, with CLT panels used for floors and walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Primary LVL columns are sized at 300 × 300 mm, with beams typically 300 × 400 mm, providing sufficient capacity for the added floors while keeping the structure readable. Transfer beams are introduced where required to align the new timber structure with the existing building below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This system allows for prefabrication, precise assembly, and a clear separation between structure, envelope, and interior partitions.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Envelope, Assembly & Safety</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The building envelope is designed as a layered timber system. CLT wall and slab panels are combined with insulation, vapour barriers, and external larch cladding to achieve thermal performance and weather protection. The envelope sequence was studied in detail to ensure buildability and clear on-site assembly.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Fire safety is addressed through compartmentalisation and the inherent charring behaviour of CLT panels, with a controlled charring rate of approximately 0.65–0.70 mm/min. Fire-resistant glass walls are used selectively to maintain openness within the communal space while meeting safety requirements.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Balconies are equipped with adjustable wooden panels that function as sun shading, allowing users to control light and privacy. Roof construction combines timber rafters, insulation layers, and Galvalume steel roofing for durability in the local climate.

                    <h3>Making & Coordination</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The project places strong emphasis on construction logic and coordination. Structural layouts, shaft routing, and envelope assemblies were developed alongside spatial design to ensure compatibility between systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Detailed studies include frame assembly sequences, joinery solutions between beams and columns, and transportation constraints for large LVL elements. Material quantities were calculated to understand the scale of timber use and its implications for construction and logistics.

                        <p>
                            Commune demonstrates an approach to architecture that balances spatial quality with structural clarity and buildability. By working with mass timber systems at building scale, the project explores how careful coordination between programme, structure, and envelope can support both sustainability and everyday use. The proposal shows how timber extensions can contribute not only additional area, but also social value to existing residential buildings.

                            Commune is a timber extension proposal for an existing multi-storey residential building at Katajaharjuntie 22 in Helsinki.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The project investigates how an added wooden volume can extend the life of an existing structure while introducing shared spaces that support everyday community use. The extension combines new housing with a flexible communal floor, forming a clear relationship between private and collective living.
