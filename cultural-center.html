                    <h3>Design Idea</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The building is conceived as a group of three units rather than a single mass. These units work together but can operate independently. The overall layout responds directly to the mountain: volumes are placed diagonally toward the slope, opening views and creating spaces between buildings that act as both paths and gathering areas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design treats the building as a “mountain pavilion,” rising gradually with the terrain. As the site moves deeper into the hillside, interior spaces also become deeper, following the change in ground level. This allows the building to feel embedded in the landscape rather than placed on top of it.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The main route connects the town to the mountain and runs through the building. People enter through a central atrium and move upward through a sequence of platforms, courtyards, and interior spaces. This route is designed so that visitors do not return along the same path, creating a continuous spatial experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Courtyards and natural platforms overlap, allowing light, air, and views to enter deep into the building. These spaces act as resting nodes along the route, where people can pause, orient themselves, and understand the relationship between the building and the mountain.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Programme is arranged according to openness and accessibility. Sports functions are placed at the lowest level, closest to the street. This area is the most open and directly serves local residents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cultural spaces occupy the middle level. The exhibition hall sits between sports and tourism functions and works as a connector.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Tourist and multimedia functions are placed higher up the slope, allowing more controlled access and quieter use. This vertical arrangement matches both user flow and site conditions, while keeping each function legible.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Structure & Construction</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The structural system follows the terrain. Primary structural lines align with contour changes so the building steps naturally with the slope. This reduces excessive earthwork and keeps a clear relationship between structure and ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A reciprocal timber beam system is used to address long spans where single beams are not sufficient. Inspired by Villard de Honnecourt’s planar grillage, four shorter beams are connected within the same plane to form a stable spanning system. This avoids sloped stacking and keeps the structure clear and buildable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Timber beams are arranged in a sequential order, reinforcing spatial hierarchy and making the construction logic easy to read from inside the building.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Spatial Experience</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Roof direction and structure define the main interior spaces. Primary and secondary spaces align with the roof system, while transitions occur where courtyards, atrium voids, and beam intersections overlap.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At these junctions, visitors can experience the structure at close range. Horizontal views toward the town are introduced from interior levels, balancing the strong vertical movement created by the slope. This contrast between horizontal views and vertical circulation gives the interior a clear spatial rhythm.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The building follows principles drawn from Jiangnan spatial traditions. Pavilion-like spaces respond to winter use, while courtyard spaces serve summer conditions. The combination allows seasonal flexibility and improves comfort in a climate with hot summers and cold winters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By layering interior space, courtyards, and outdoor platforms, the design maximises daylight and ventilation while maintaining usable area.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The project is driven by three decisions: follow the mountain, organise space through units rather than mass, and let structure guide movement. Construction is treated as part of the experience, allowing users to understand how the building works as they move through it. The result is a public building that supports daily use, seasonal change, and long-term integration with its landscape.

                            The site sits on a former quarry depression complex contours. The design uses the slope to organise movement, programme, and structure, turning the building into a midway stop between the residential area and the mountain.
