                    <h3>Design Context</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The site lies within Longtan Old Street, an area with strong Jiangnan characteristics and a long cultural history. The surrounding landscape includes dense vegetation, mountain terrain, and a network of historic paths that link daily village life with the hillside.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Tea Room is positioned where the slope begins to rise more steeply. Rather than standing as a destination object, it works as part of the larger movement system, supporting both local residents and visitors moving between the town and the mountain.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Design Idea</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The design focuses on creating a calm, inward-looking space within an active natural setting. The approach path is deliberately indirect, using height changes and vegetation to slow movement and prepare visitors for a quieter interior environment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The building is organised to support activities such as tea drinking, reading, conversation, and short-term rest. These uses require both connection to the surrounding landscape and moments of visual control, allowing users to shift between focus and openness.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div class="text-block-row" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h3>Spatial Organisation</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Entry occurs from the uphill side, where the building is partially embedded into the slope. Interior spaces open gradually toward the landscape, framing views of the surrounding hills and valleys.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The tea space is arranged so that users first encounter a more contained interior. Visual openness increases as one moves deeper into the building, allowing attention to shift from the act of tea tasting to the broader landscape. This spatial sequence supports a slow transition between inward concentration and outward observation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Changes in floor height and ceiling alignment respond to the slope, reinforcing the sense of movement through the building rather than a single, static room.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="text-block-row" data-aos="fade-up">
                    <h3>Material & Atmosphere</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The interior uses repurposed wood and concrete. The material choice reinforces a tactile, warm atmosphere and ties the building to local construction practices. Wood is used not as decoration, but as a way to shape light, enclosure, and acoustic comfort.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Openings are carefully positioned to balance enclosure and view. Rather than fully exposing the landscape at once, the building allows views to appear gradually, maintaining a sense of calm during use.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Tea drinking requires attention and slowness. The design introduces moments where the surrounding scenery is softened or partially filtered, allowing users to focus on taste and aroma before engaging fully with the view outside.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the experience unfolds, the architecture shifts from controlled enclosure to openness, aligning the act of tea tasting with the rhythm of the landscape and the passage of time.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The Tea Room explores how small-scale architecture can shape experience through sequence, section, and material rather than formal expression. By working closely with terrain, vegetation, and movement, the building becomes part of the hillside route rather than a detached object. The project reflects an interest in architecture that supports everyday rituals and quiet use, while remaining deeply connected to its environment.

                        <p>
                            The Tea Room is a small hillside building in Longtan, Nanjing, located along the main route connecting the mountain to the Cultural–Tourism Center.

                        <p>
                            The project sits on a sloped, forested site and is approached through a gradual ascent. The building is conceived as a quiet stop along this route, offering space for rest, reading, and informal gathering.
