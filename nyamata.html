                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Nyamata District Hospital has grown incrementally over time. As new departments were added, circulation became increasingly fragmented. Patient routes overlap with visitor movement, corridors are frequently blocked, and waiting areas are undersized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Key issues identified through on-site observation included congested patient flow in the OPD and emergency areas, poor connection between maternity and critical care units, and steep ramps limiting accessibility. These conditions increase stress for patients and staff, and slow down critical movement within the hospital.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Design Approach</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Our work focused on early-stage, buildable interventions that could improve conditions without disrupting daily hospital operations. Instead of adding enclosed buildings, we worked with open, lightweight structures that improve comfort while keeping circulation clear and flexible.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The design priorities were clarifying patient circulation routes, reducing overlap between patient and visitor movement, improving accessibility for wheelchairs and stretchers, and expanding waiting areas to reduce congestion.

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The proposal concentrates on the OPD extension and its surrounding circulation areas. Ramps and corridors were redesigned to reduce slope, increase width, and improve visibility between departments. Seating was added along main waiting routes to prevent crowding in narrow passages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lightweight roofs and shelters were introduced above waiting areas to provide protection from sun and rain while maintaining airflow. These elements are positioned to support natural movement rather than interrupt it. Locally available materials such as clay bricks and planted screens ensure the proposal remains affordable and culturally appropriate.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Structure & Materials</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The proposed structures use a simple timber framework that can be assembled with basic tools and local construction skills. Bamboo shading and planted layers help reduce heat while keeping spaces visually open.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The construction logic is modular, allowing elements to be built in phases and adapted over time as hospital needs evolve. This approach ensures that improvements can be implemented quickly and maintained easily by the local team.

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            This project shows how architectural adjustments can significantly improve daily conditions in high-pressure public buildings. By focusing on movement, shelter, and accessibility, the proposal supports safer and more efficient hospital use without relying on complex systems or large budgets.
                        
                            The work strengthened our understanding of design under real constraints, where speed, clarity, and usability matter more than formal expression, and where collaboration with local users is essential.

                            This project was developed during an on-site design camp at Nyamata District Hospital in Rwanda.
                        
                            The work focused on improving patient flow and everyday usability within an active hospital environment through direct architectural interventions. Rather than proposing a complete rebuild, the design enhances existing connections, accessibility, and waiting conditions.
